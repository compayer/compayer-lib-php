Compayer is a stat data preprocessor and web analytics service that tracks customer events in payment forms for financial and marketing reports.

Compayer PHP SDK library is designed to push stat messages to PaySuper Analytics from the php-based projects.

| |The Compayer Architecture|
|---|---|
|**Accepting data**|[Compayer Receiver](https://github.com/compayer/compayer-receiver) is a microservice that accepts the events with data to send them to the Rabbit queue and logs.|
|**Storing data**|[Compayer Collector](https://github.com/compayer/compayer-collector) is a microservice that processes data and stores in a uniform format in the database.|
|**Creating reports**|[Compayer Reporter](https://github.com/compayer/compayer-reporter) is an API backend for [Compayer Portal](https://github.com/compayer/compayer-portal) that reads data from the database for building all kinds of reports.|
|**Displaying reports**|[Compayer Portal](https://github.com/compayer/compayer-portal) is a frontend to represent the reports.|
|**Storing user accounts**|[Compayer Accounts](https://github.com/compayer/compayer-accounts) is a microservice that stores the Compayer user accounts and performs a user registration and authentication.|

## Features
- Creates and send the Event of start, success, fail or refund to the Compare analytics.
- Help to convert response message from Yandex.Money, Xsolla and Paysuper to the Event message.

## Requirements
- PHP >=5.5
- Required PHP extensions: *json*

## Getting Started

Register your account in [Compayer](https://compayer.com) analytics to get:
- CLIENT ID (unique identifier for your client)
- SECRET KEY (secret API key for your client)

## Installation

We recommend installing Compayer PHP SDK using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/your/project
$ composer require compayer/compayer-lib-php
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Usage

To use analytics you need to send 2 events: 
- The `start` event when a user initiates a payment. The `start` event is optional, but we strongly recommend using it to track the entire payment chain. 
- One of events `success`, `fail` or `refund` after the payment system responds about the result of the operation.

The event tries automatically determine the user IP address and address of the payment initiation page based on the data from the server request. 
If the userâ€™s request is not available to the script, you can set the payment initiation page or user IP address by yourself (this is necessary for the geolocation filters to work correctly).

To send a `start` event, use the following example:

```php
use Compayer\SDK\Client;
use Compayer\SDK\Event;

const DATA_SOURCE = 'data_source_id';
const SECRET_KEY = 'secret_key';

// Initialization of the client for sending events.
// Available configuration parameters can be found in the class constants Client::CONFIG_*.
$client = Client::create([
    Client::CONFIG_DATA_SOURCE => DATA_SOURCE,
    Client::CONFIG_SECRET_KEY => SECRET_KEY,
]);

// Create an instance of the Event class and set the maximum possible properties about the user and payment.
// All fields are optional, but you must fill out one of the fields: "userEmails", "userPhones" or "userAccounts" 
// to identify the user who made the payment.
$event = (new Event())
    ->setMerchantTransactionId('12345')
    ->setPaymentAmount(250.50)
    ->setPaymentCurrency('RUB')
    ->setUserLang('RUS')
    ->setUserEmails(['customer@compayer.com'])
    ->setUserAccounts(['54321'])
    ->setExtra(['my_property' => 'value']);

// You can also create an object with an event from an array, 
// where the names of the keys of the array match the names of the Event properties.
$event = Event::fromArray([
    'merchantTransactionId' => '12345',
    'paymentAmount' => 250.50,
    'paymentCurrency' => 'RUB',
    'userLang' => 'RUS',
    'userEmails' => ['customer@compayer.com'],
    'userAccounts' => ['54321'],
    'extra' => ['my_property' => 'value'],
]);

// Send the generated event and get the generated transaction identifier.
// Use it to send "success", "fail" or "refund" events to chain events.
// Transaction identifier is UUID and is a string like 3677eb06-1a9a-4b6c-9d6a-1799cae1b6bb.
$transactionId = $client->pushStartEvent($event);
```

After a payment system has received a response about a payment result (`success`, `failure` or `refund`), you need to send an event with the data that you received after the payment. 
You can form the response event as described in the `start` event example above. If you received a transaction ID at the start step, set it to link the entire payment chain.

For `success`, `failure` or `refund` events a payment system response is required in its original form.
The response should be written as a string with the key "response" in the property `extra`.

For example, if the answer received in the jSON format then use the construct: `setPaymentSystemResponse(json_encode($jsonPaymentSystemResponse))`.

```php
use Compayer\SDK\Client;
use Compayer\SDK\Event;

const DATA_SOURCE = 'data_source_id';
const SECRET_KEY = 'secret_key';

// Transaction ID received on start event
$transactionId = '3677eb06-1a9a-4b6c-9d6a-1799cae1b6bb';

// Initialization of the client for sending events.
// Available configuration parameters can be found in the class constants Client::CONFIG_*.
$client = Client::create([
    Client::CONFIG_DATA_SOURCE => DATA_SOURCE,
    Client::CONFIG_SECRET_KEY => SECRET_KEY,
]);

// Create an instance of the Event class and set the maximum possible properties about the user and payment
// All fields are optional, but you must fill out one of the fields: "userEmails", "userPhones" or "userAccounts" 
// to identify the user who made the payment. If you have a transaction ID for the start event, specify it.
$event = (new Event())
    ->setTransactionId($transactionId)
    ->setMerchantTransactionId('12345')
    ->setPaymentAmount(250.50)
    ->setPaymentCurrency('RUB')
    ->setPayoutAmount(3.87)
    ->setPayoutCurrency('USD')
    ->setUserEmails(['customer@compayer.com'])
    ->setUserAccounts(['54321'])
    ->setExtra(['my_property' => 'value'])
    ->setPaymentSystemResponse('Payment system response as a string');

// Send the generated event
// Or use $client->pushFailEvent($event) in case of payment failure
// Or use $client->pushRefundEvent($event) in case of payment refund
$client->pushSuccessEvent($event);
```
